# win32-direct2d

this is a functioning minimal win32 app that uses Direct2D to draw a few things on screen. avert your gaze from the decommented code intending to load images and dream not. i'm not sure if microsoft cares if it works or knows it's supposed to.

basically my life of intraculturality has made me fear other peoples' code. i will spazz and break your things before accepting an unnecessary SDK or layer between code and access. it's like the way people think python is great when it's just wrong. maybe convenience and death equate huh, did you ever think of that huh.

but direct2d is the most accursed windows API i've encountered. it's a pretty cool idea, a relatively low investment way to draw things faster without full on acknolwedgement of D3D, but i don't think anyone else has ever used it.

i tend to use very modest computing platforms for very modest applications. i've made a few 3d games using rendering methods that yielded under 1000 triangles per frame. i get frustrated trying to learn thnigs when nobody accepts that i want to build upon the basis i have established using the default win32 application. i don't want to have to restructure my concept of windows code to use a method.

so D2D is a cool idea.

but when you look for support for Direct2D.. i found a 45 minute video of some microsoft employee announcing its release at a podium, that was about all. i bet i'm still the second comment on that video.

yes. i want to know, where this stuff is supposed to go, in relation to, a default, win32, document, geniuses.

you're bad people.
